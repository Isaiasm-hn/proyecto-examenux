            <p>SPORTMiX® High Protein may be fed dry or moistened according to your dog’s preference. If moist food is preferred, mix 4 parts SPORTMiX® High Protein with 1 part water, milk or broth. Use the chart as a guide. One feeding per day is acceptable, however, 2 feedings each of one half the daily requirement is recommended. Puppies may be started on SPORTMiX® High Protein as soon as they are old enough to take solid nourishment. Feed your puppy a mixture of 2 parts SPORTMiX® High Protein with 1 part warm liquid until the puppy is 2 months old. After 2 months, feed your puppy all it will eat in a 20-minute period, 4 times a day, gradually reducing to a single daily feeding by 1 year of age. Lactating dogs require 2 to 3 times as much food as adult dogs. Remember, these amounts are averages and will vary depending upon the breed, size and age of your dog. Have clean, fresh water available at all times. For your pet’s best health, see your veterinarian regularly.</p>
